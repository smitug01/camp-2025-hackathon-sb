Since 2014, SITCON Camp has reached its ninth edition, offering courses across a wide range of topics including open source, cybersecurity, maker projects, Python, Node.js, front-end web scraping, data visualization, Telegram bots, and more. The camp also features interactive activities like community challenges, the Vision Café, and hackathons to encourage students to get hands-on and discover their interests and strengths.",

Getting lost or encountering errors is perfectly natural. By continuously trying and bravely pushing boundaries, everyone can find their own path through confusion. Just like coding—when problems arise, debug bravely, iterate persistently, and turn every mistake into a chance to grow, creating something meaningful and uniquely brilliant.",
          "AI is leading a new wave in technology, and SITCON Camp 2025 is introducing AI-assisted front-end development courses for the first time. Combined with beginner-friendly back-end programming lessons, the camp will guide students in building their own web applications from scratch. Whether it's crafting useful tools for everyday needs or unleashing imagination to create new innovations, AI can help turn ideas into reality. Through hands-on projects, students will not only understand how AI tools work but also develop interdisciplinary thinking, grasp future tech trends, and carve out a brilliant future of their own.",
